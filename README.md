# Sign Language Recognition

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a model for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. It employs the InceptionV3 architecture with pre-trained weights for transfer learning. The code preprocesses image data, applies augmentation, and trains the model on a labeled dataset. Custom callbacks monitor accuracy, stopping training when it reaches 99% on both training and validation sets. Users can visualize sample images and adjust paths to run the model in their own environments.
